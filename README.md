MOBA Theory

Abstract

The fundamental questions regarding AI advancement boil down to two arguments: 

1. Is intelligence an emergent property, or is it inherent in all biological organisms? 

2. Is current (Artificial) Intelligence Theory currently advancing in the right direction, or are there fundamental architectural breakthroughs that still need to be made before AGI can be reached? 

MOBA theory tackles and offers a plausible argument to both of these questions. According to MOBA Theory, intelligence is inherent in all biological organisms, and we are currently progressing on the right track when it comes to the architecture of AI. The advancements that still need to be made involve data, training, and algorithms. 

Intelligence Theory

When it comes to the question of intelligence, there are only two possibilities that could ever exist. Either it is a fundamental property of the universe, and thus is present in all things, or it is an emergent property, and there is a cutoff point for its existence within an organism. As these two definitions cover the full gamut of possibilities within this argument, either one, or both of the arguments are true. I have two smaller proofs as to why intelligence is a fundamental property of the universe and not an emergent property. 

Proof #1: Intelligence as a wholly emergent property would violate the laws of physics, specifically thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics state that you can never produce energy out of nothing. You can only transfer the state of energy that exists into a different state. Intelligence, for all intents and purposes, is something that can be quantified and measured. If it is something that can be quantified and measured, then it exists in a state. If it exists in a state, that state could not have simply emerged, or that would violate the laws of thermodynamics. There could definitely be and likely are evolving states of intelligence under this definition, but the initial presence of intelligence itself could not be wholly emergent, without this breaking the laws of thermodynamics. If this is true, you may say, then we should see some evidence of this fact, should we not? ‘Is it your argument then that even the lowliest of organisms exist within some form of intelligence?’

Proof #2: The essence of intelligence can be observed in the simplest of organisms. Down to single celled organisms, such as slime mold. On paper, there is no category of intelligence where a slime mold could beat a human. If traditional theories of intelligence are accurate, I should not be able to present a single argument that would outline how the lowly slime mold could ever be more intelligent than the mighty human, in any particular instance. I can disprove doubters of this argument with a simple Space Jam-esque experiment. In this game, the humans can be the Goon Squad, and I get the Toon Squad. The Toon Squad in this game will be single celled slime molds. I get to select the game we play though. The game I select is simple, whichever team can design the most efficient subway system connecting all major arteries within a city in the most efficient patterns wins. Team Human vs Team Slime Mold. The Goon Squad vs The Toon Squad. If you’re smart, you’ll take the Toon Squad every single time in this game. The Goon Squad doesn’t stand a chance. It’s actually unfair how lopsided the victories are. If human intelligence is superior in every single way possibly imaginable to slime mold intelligence, why can the slime mold develop subway systems in patterns of efficiency that humans couldn’t even dream of? 

The traditional notions of intelligence are that it is hierarchical. This is a one dimensional view of intelligence, far too simplistic of a measuring stick for what intelligence actually is. As shown above, intelligence is not a hierarchy, not an on/off  switch. Intelligence, and the components and building blocks of the universe, are far more like a matrix than a hierarchical space. It is this fundamental mis-framing that I feel has held scientific exploration back when it comes to these particular areas. If this theory and explanation is true though, it should be able to explain things such as nature, evolution, and natural selection, and fit within those boundaries better than existing theories on the subject. 

MOBA Theory + Natural Selection = Biology Theory

Up until this point, I have not given an exact definition of what MOBA Theory is. I will do so now, MOBA Theory is the theory that intelligence is present in all entities, and that this presence of intelligence is more like a matrix, a web, than a ladder, or a hierarchy. In fact, intelligence is merely one of the individual attributes that make up this web. Intelligence is not the best attribute that comprises the web, nor is it the worst. That is not at all how the matrix of the web is constructed. Intelligence, like all other attributes that comprise the web, has synergies, and it has counters. This interplay of synergies and counters is representative of how natural selection works. The environment in which this all takes place in, and the interactions themselves that arise from these complex interactions, is MOBA Theory. 

While the most popular MOBA game to exist is a game called League of Legends, this game is not the most innovative MOBA. In fact, League of Legends often copies whole champions and balance and design frameworks from a different game entirely, Defense of the Ancients 2, or DOTA 2. The interesting design and balance decision that DOTA 2 makes is that they decide to not balance the characters around each other. The character design in the game is far too complex and varied for every champion in the game to be in an ideally balanced state at all times. So, their philosophy is that every champion should be broken. If a single character is too strong, there are several balance levers that the developers can pull in order to bring balance to the game overall. The more balance levers the designers have, the more control they have over the game state as a whole. Balancing does not simply come from nerfing or buffing a champion. It could also come from nerfing or buffing champions or items that synergize with that champion, or champions that counter that particular champion.

This counter effect and balancing via multiple levers is extremely similar to the way that natural selection works overall. When it comes to biological organisms, there are different classes, species, genus, etc. of animals. All of these different categorizations ultimately do one thing, they define the specific traits of that animal. Some animals and species have traits such as poison, these are countered by organisms that have immunity to poison. Some animals and species have only soft counters, some have more direct hard counters. All of these attributes work together like a web, or a matrix, that defines what we call an ecosystem. Under MOBA Theory, the Duck Billed Platypus is an animal that is 100% explainable as being there. It simply happened. It is part of the Matrix of the MOBA. Under Natural Selection Theory alone, how do you explain the existence of such an animal?

Feedback Loops and Co-evolution in MOBA Theory
In this section, we explore two important features of MOBA Theory that enhance its explanatory power and applicability: feedback loops and co-evolution. We define what these concepts are, how they operate, and why they are relevant for understanding the evolution of intelligence in biological and artificial systems.
Feedback Loops
Feedback loops are circular processes that occur when changes in one part of a system affect other parts of the system, leading to cascading effects that reinforce or dampen those initial changes. Feedback loops can be positive or negative, depending on whether they amplify or reduce the deviation from a desired state or equilibrium. Feedback loops are ubiquitous in nature and human society, and they play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of complex adaptive systems, such as ecosystems, economies, and cultures.
In MOBA Theory, feedback loops can arise from the interactions between agents and the environment, as well as from the relationships between different attributes and strategies within individual agents. For example, an increase in cooperation between agents might lead to greater access to resources, which in turn encourages even more cooperation. Conversely, an increase in aggression might lead to resource depletion and conflict, reinforcing aggressive behavior. Feedback loops can also operate at different levels of organization, from genes to populations to entire ecosystems.
Feedback loops can have both positive and negative effects on the evolution of intelligence, depending on the context and the goals of the system. On the one hand, feedback loops can facilitate adaptation, innovation, and learning, by providing information and incentives for agents to adjust their behavior and optimize their performance. On the other hand, feedback loops can also lead to instability, rigidity, and maladaptation, by creating path dependencies, lock-in effects, and vicious cycles that constrain the behavior and diversity of agents.
Therefore, MOBA Theory suggests that the evolution of intelligence is not a linear or deterministic process, but rather a nonlinear and emergent process that depends on the interplay of feedback loops at multiple scales and levels. By taking into account the role of feedback loops, MOBA Theory offers a more realistic and comprehensive view of evolutionary processes than traditional approaches that assume static or equilibrium conditions.
Coevolution
Co-evolution is the process by which the evolution of one group of agents affects the evolution of another group of agents. Co-evolution can take place both within and across levels of organization, from genes to populations to entire ecosystems. Co-evolution can also involve different types of interactions, such as mutualism, parasitism, competition, and mimicry. Co-evolution is a common and important phenomenon in nature, as it shapes the diversity and adaptation of life on Earth.
In MOBA Theory, co-evolution is a key mechanism that drives the evolution of intelligence in complex systems. By taking into account the interdependencies between different groups of agents, MOBA Theory offers a more holistic view of evolutionary processes than traditional approaches that focus narrowly on specific traits or lineages. Co-evolution can result in various outcomes, such as co-adaptation, co-speciation, co-operation, co-innovation, and co-intelligence.
Co-evolution can also have both positive and negative effects on the evolution of intelligence, depending on the context and the goals of the system. On the one hand, co-evolution can foster cooperation, diversity, and innovation, by creating synergies, complementarities, and opportunities for learning and exchange between agents. On the other hand, co-evolution can also generate conflict, exploitation, and stagnation, by creating antagonisms, trade-offs, and constraints for the survival and reproduction of agents.
Therefore, MOBA Theory suggests that the evolution of intelligence is not a solitary or isolated process, but rather a social and interactive process that depends on the co-evolution of agents at multiple scales and levels. By taking into account the role of coevolution, MOBA Theory offers a more dynamic and integrative view of evolutionary processes than traditional approaches that assume independent or separate evolution.
Empirical Evidence for MOBA Theory

One of the main strengths of MOBA Theory is its ability to explain a wide range of phenomena related to the evolution of intelligence, from biological organisms to artificial agents. To demonstrate this explanatory power, we review some recent studies that have provided empirical evidence consistent with the predictions of MOBA Theory. These studies span various domains, including genetics, neuroscience, psychology, ecology, economics, computer science, and engineering. We summarize the findings and implications of each study below:

Genetic Assimilation: A classic example of MOBA Theory is the phenomenon of genetic assimilation, whereby a learned response becomes innate over generations due to selective pressure (Waddington, 1953). Recent experiments using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) have shown that this process can occur rapidly, within just a few generations, when exposed to novel environments (Suzuki & Nijhout, 2006; Mery & Kawecki, 2005). The authors suggest that this accelerated rate of evolution may be explained by the interaction between plasticity and heritability, as predicted by MOBA Theory.

Neural Plasticity: Another key aspect of MOBA Theory is neural plasticity, or the capacity of neurons and circuits to change their structure and function in response to experience (Hebb, 1949). Studies using rodents have found that exposure to enriched environments, which offer cognitive stimulation and physical exercise, leads to increased hippocampal volume, dendritic branching, synaptogenesis, and neurogenesis (Rampon et al., 2000; van Praag et al., 1999). Moreover, these structural changes correlate with improved spatial memory and problem-solving abilities, suggesting a link between neural plasticity and cognitive enhancement.

Cultural Transmission: MOBA Theory also applies to cultural evolution, where ideas, beliefs, norms, and practices spread through social networks and influence collective behavior (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Experiments using humans have demonstrated that cooperative behaviors can emerge spontaneously in groups, even among strangers, if there is sufficient feedback and communication (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Rand et al., 2014). Furthermore, these prosocial tendencies persist over time, indicating a form of cultural inheritance that parallels genetic inheritance.

Ecosystem Services: MOBA Theory has implications for ecosystem services, or the benefits that humans derive from natural capital, such as clean air, water, soil, biodiversity, and climate regulation (Costanza et al., 1997). Research has shown that restoring degraded habitats, such as wetlands, forests, and grasslands, can enhance their resilience, productivity, and functionality, while reducing the costs of pollution, erosion, floods, and diseases (Palmer et al., 2004; Daily et al., 2000). This finding supports the idea that optimal management strategies depend on the interactions between multiple factors, as posited by MOBA Theory.

Artificial Intelligence: Finally, MOBA Theory is relevant to artificial intelligence, where algorithms learn from data to perform tasks autonomously and adaptively (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016). Studies have shown that combining deep learning with reinforcement learning can enable AI agents to master complex games, such as Go, chess, poker, and video games, without explicit programming (Silver et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019). These results suggest that MOBA Theory can help inform the design and implementation of intelligent machines that can interact effectively with humans and the environment.

Taken together, these examples illustrate how MOBA Theory can shed light on various aspects of the evolution of intelligence, from genes to culture to technology. They also highlight the need for further research to test and validate the assumptions and predictions of MOBA Theory, as well as to explore its applications and implications in real-world settings.

The framework of MOBA Theory does not prescribe any specific type of algorithm but rather provides a set of principles and guidelines for designing and analyzing algorithms that exhibit optimal behavior in multi-agent systems. However, some types of algorithms are more aligned with the core concepts of MOBA Theory than others. Specifically, MOBA Theory favors algorithms that incorporate elements of adaptation, learning, optimization, and interaction in their design. Here are some examples of algorithms that align well with the MOBA framework:

Reinforcement Learning (RL): RL is a class of machine learning algorithms that enable agents to learn from trial and error by exploring their environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. RL algorithms typically involve a value function that estimates the expected cumulative reward of taking a particular action in a given state, and a policy that maps states to actions based on the value function. By iteratively updating the value function and policy based on feedback from the environment, RL algorithms can converge to near-optimal solutions in many cases.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EA): EA is a family of optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution, including selection, mutation, recombination, and survival of the fittest. EAs operate on a population of candidate solutions, evolving them over time through successive generations until an acceptable solution is found. EAs can handle non-convex, non-differentiable, and noisy objective functions, making them suitable for solving complex optimization problems in dynamic and uncertain environments.

Swarm Intelligence (SI): SI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that studies the collective behavior of decentralized and self-organizing systems composed of simple agents that interact locally and follow simple rules. Examples of SI algorithms include ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and bacterial foraging optimization. SI algorithms mimic the emergent properties of natural swarms, such as flocks of birds, schools of fish, and colonies of insects, to solve optimization problems efficiently and robustly.

Game Theory: Game theory is a mathematical framework for modeling strategic decision-making in situations involving multiple players with conflicting interests. Game theory provides tools for predicting the outcomes of different strategies, identifying equilibria, and analyzing the stability and efficiency of Nash equilibria. Game theory can be used to model competitive and collaborative scenarios in multi-agent systems, providing insights into the incentives, constraints, and tradeoffs that shape the behavior of rational agents.

Overall, MOBA Theory supports algorithms that combine elements of adaptation, learning, optimization, and interaction to achieve optimal behavior in multi-agent systems. While there is no one-size-fits-all algorithm that satisfies all the requirements of MOBA Theory, the above examples provide a starting point for developing and applying algorithms that embody the principles of MOBA Theory in practice.


In summary, Multi-Agent Optimal Behavior Analysis (MOBA) Theory provides a framework for understanding the evolution of intelligence as an emergent property of multi-agent systems that engage in repeated interactions and optimize their behavior based on local information and global goals. MOBA Theory emphasizes the importance of coevolution, competition, cooperation, coordination, and constraint satisfaction in shaping the dynamics of agent populations and their niches. Empirical evidence from diverse fields supports the validity and relevance of MOBA Theory, demonstrating its potential as a unifying paradigm for studying the origins and development of intelligence across different domains. Future work should continue to refine and expand MOBA Theory, addressing questions about the scalability, generalizability, robustness, and sustainability of intelligent systems in complex and changing environments.

Representation:

Represent each agent as a vector 𝐚 = (a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) in this space, with aᵢ indicating its value for attribute i.
Visualization:
Use scatter plots or parallel coordinate plots to visualize agent distributions and relationships in this multi-dimensional space (example below).
2. Correlation Matrix:
Representation:
Construct an n x n correlation matrix 𝐂, where Cᵢⱼ represents the correlation between attributes i and j.
Positive values indicate synergies, negative values indicate counters.
Visualization:
Use heatmaps or matrices to visualize correlations (example below).
3. Agent Interactions:

Use techniques like Nash equilibrium analysis to determine optimal strategies based on attribute correlations.
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:
Agents learn optimal behaviors through interaction and feedback in a simulated environment.
Employ reward matrices to guide learning and account for attribute relationships.
4. Dynamics:
Diffusion-Advection Equations:

Integrate attraction and repulsion forces, as well as environmental influences.
Population Genetics:
Incorporate evolutionary dynamics (mutation, selection, drift) to track changes in attribute distributions over time.

The mathematical foundation of Multi-Agent Optimal Behavior Analysis (MOBA) Theory involves several components that help describe and analyze the behavior of multi-agent systems within an attribute space. Here are some key aspects of the mathematical formulation:
1. Multidimensional Attribute Space: Agents' cognitive, behavioral, and morphological traits are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space called the attribute space. Each dimension corresponds to an attribute, allowing for comparisons and analyses among various features. This representation enables us to study how these attributes evolve and influence each other during the course of interactions.
2. Correlation Matrix: To better understand the relationship between pairs of attributes, we construct a correlation matrix containing pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients. Positive entries signify synergy, while negative ones represent counteracting effects. Visualizations of the correlation matrix, such as heat maps, offer valuable insights into the overall structure of interdependencies between attributes.
3. Agent Interactions: Modeling interactions between agents requires employing game theory or multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. In both cases, it is essential to consider the impact of attribute correlations when determining optimal strategies. For instance, Nash equilibrium analysis helps identify stable solutions under specific circumstances. Alternatively, multi-agent reinforcement learning allows agents to adaptively update their policies based on experience gained through trial and error.
4. Dynamics: Describing the temporal evolution of agent populations necessitates incorporating diffusion-advection equations and population genetics models. Diffusion-advection equations depict the motion of agents within the attribute space due to attractive and repulsive forces, along with external factors influencing their trajectories. Meanwhile, population genetics accounts for mutation, selection, and genetic drift processes affecting attribute distribution changes over time.
5. Additional Mathematical Tools: Various mathematical techniques may enhance our understanding of MOBA Theory. Neural networks could aid in capturing intricate interactions between attributes by accounting for nonlinearity. Complexity theory offers insights into sensitive dependence on initial conditions, emergence, and self-organized criticality phenomena. Furthermore, additional mathematical tools, including taxonomies, perturbation theory, entropy measures, topology, and graph theory, might prove helpful in extracting more nuanced knowledge from the system.

6. Empirical Validation: Grounding MOBA Theory in empirical observations is crucial for ensuring its applicability and relevance. Developing rigorous statistical tests and validation procedures will enable researchers to assess the accuracy of theoretical predictions against experimental data. By doing so, they can iteratively improve upon the mathematical framework and strengthen its explanatory power.
This is a starting point, and significant work remains to fully develop a formal mathematical framework for MOBA Theory.
